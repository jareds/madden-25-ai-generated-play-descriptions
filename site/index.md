# Madden 25 AI generated play descriptions

## Introduction
This site contains AI-generated play, formation, and set descriptions for Madden 25. I created this specifically to allow me to more easily play Madden 25 while totally blind. While Madden 25 has some accessibility features the only information available for a play is the play name, formation, and set. Using the ai generated play data, I've been able to create custom offense playbooks that let me understand the plays being called and set the situations when I want them to come up as options.

## Disclaimer
There are over 6,000 unique plays in Madden 25. I don't have the time or interest to verify the accuracy of the AI-generated information for every play. I've focused mainly on creating custom offense playbooks from the play descriptions, and the descriptions have generally been accurate. Plays listed as runs or passes have matched the type when I called them in the game. I've only looked at a couple hundred plays, so I assume there are likely issues I have not found.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
The information on this site assumes you have a decent knowledge of football. Plays are sorted into situations and types. Information on positions, rules, game situations, etc is not specifically explained, although it may show up in play descriptions.

## Organization
Every page has an offense and defense button. Clicking a button will expand a menu containing links. Each link goes to the playbook with that name. There is also an “All” playbook for both offense and defense. The All playbook is a page containing every play regardless of what playbook the play is part of.

Each page is organized in the following way:

* Set name as a level two heading.  
* Set description.  
* Each formation that is part of the set is a level three heading.  
* Situation the play is generally meant for (such as short yardage, medium yardage, etc.) is a level four heading.  
* Play type (run or pass) is a level five heading.  
* Play name is a level six heading.  
* Under each play name, a description of the play.
